id		async_load[? "id"];
socket id of the server receiving or socket receiving the event

if event triggered in client,
id = TCP/UDP socket that triggered the event
AKA
id = socket id of SERVER/sender

if event triggered in server
id = socket id of CLIENT that sent data


ip		async_load[? "ip"];
ip address of the socket, is a string

port	async_load[? "port"];
port associated with ip, useful when working with UDP



type	async_load[? "type"];
types aka categories can be
network_type_connect - connection
network_type_disconnect - disconnection
network_type_data - incoming data
network_type_non_blocking_connect (ignore this one I think)


during network_type_dis/connect,
the async_load map will have "socket"

socket		async_load[? "socket"];
holds the dis/connecting socket id
(add clients to another ds_map this way)


When SERVER disconnects, CLIENTS DO NOT get the disconnect type


more on network_type_data / receiving data

buffer		async_load[? "buffer"];
unique "buffer id" generated by event (network_type_data)

the buffer created is
a grow type buffer
byte aligned to 1
and should be stored in a variable

it should only be used in the networking event,
and is removed when the networking event ends
so I think it's already cleaned up? gotta check

size		async_load[? "size"];
size (in bytes) of buffer
